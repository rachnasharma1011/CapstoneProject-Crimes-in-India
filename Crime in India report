In India, there is unrest among youth, peasants, industrial workers, students, government employees, women, scheduled caste, scheduled tribe and the minorities. This unrest increases frustrations and strains which lead to the violation of legal and social norms. Crime Rate in India
is reported 385.5 in 2019 which has been increasing by upward trend since 1980 as per the data provided by National Crime Records Bureau, Ministry of Home Affairs, and Government of India. An attempt is made to find the relationship between the crime rate and various other aspects using the various datasets having different parameters like population, area, literacy rate. It was very shocking to see that there are many states with a very high Literacy rate and contrarily a high crime rate too and on the other hand there are many states with almost nil crime rate. We analysed the crime data for different time frames like 2001-2011. We also analysed a recent data for 2020 and analysed the four major crime categories i.e Murder, Rape, Theft and Kidnapping and abduction and on the basis of the analysi we categorized the districts as sensitive, moderate and peaceful areas. It was a great insight working on the analysis of Crimes in India dataset. We used various methods to analyse the various problem using comparison and visualisation. For proper analysis there are some more factors which should have been taken like income, family background and many other factors which also play a very vital role in the accurate analysis of the various types of crimes.
